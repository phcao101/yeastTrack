GitHub Instructions:

git clone <repository>
  pulls any repository in using its URL

git status
  shows what's different between our local repository and GitHub

git add <file>
  <file> becomes a change to be committed (adding said file)

git commit -m "added file"
  locks the change into our local repository. "-m" means I'm giving it a "message" which should be in quotes.
  After committing, the change will be made on YOUR machine. It's locked into your repository but it's not synced up to
  the repository on GitHub.com yet.

git push
  will take any commit on our machine and push it up to GitHub.com

git pull
  will pull down changes made from another user from GitHub.com

**keep in mind that these commands will only work if you are in the directory that is the GitHub repository
(the file you cloned at the start)""
